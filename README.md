## Why make it more accessible?

```
Accesibility has become a very important subjet, because is necessary to ensure a site can be used by everyone
```

## Process


The page was designed by using html and the style using CSS, the first aspect to consider was the desing of the page on the browser and then correct the html code and styling

- The page was not named correctly, it was rename by Horiseon Social Solution Services Homepage
